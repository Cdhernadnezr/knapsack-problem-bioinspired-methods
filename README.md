# knapsack-problem-bioinspired-methods
This project solves the 0-1 knapsack problem using bioinspired algorithms: Genetic Algorithm, Ant Colony Optimization, and Simulated Annealing. Each method seeks to maximize item value without exceeding weight limits. Input data is in an Excel file, and results include optimal solutions and convergence graphs.
